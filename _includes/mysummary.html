<p>I'm currently finishing a masters degree in computer science at Depaul University. </br>
For the past three years I was working full-time and taking classes at night, but decided </br>
to pursue the degree full-time in September 2013.  I worked in the proprietary trading </br>
industry for a number of years and slowly began writing code to develop automated trading</br> applications.  In addition I began applying some financial data analysis techniques to model </br>
different financial instruments.  To further develop my technical skills I decided to get a </br>
Masters in Computer Science.  As part of my course work I have decided to concentrate on </br>
Artificial Intelligence and have been studying data mining, machine learning, and distributed </br>
file systems such as Hadoop. Upon graduation I plan to work in an industry which utilizes </br>
big data solutions to further business operations. </p>

I'm currently finishing a masters degree in computer science at Depaul University. 
For the past three years I was working full-time and taking classes at night, but decided 
to pursue the degree full-time in September 2013.  I worked in the proprietary trading 
industry for a number of years and slowly began writing code to develop automated trading applications.  In addition I began applying some financial data analysis techniques to model 
different financial instruments.  To further develop my technical skills I decided to get a 
Masters in Computer Science.  As part of my course work I have decided to concentrate on 
Artificial Intelligence and have been studying data mining, machine learning, and distributed 
file systems such as Hadoop. Upon graduation I plan to work in an industry which utilizes 
big data solutions to further business operations.

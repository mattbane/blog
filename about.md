Currently I am working in the ad tech industry doing back end development.  I spend 
most of my professional time writing Java code for a highly distributed ad server 
which processes billions of requests per day.  Part of my day also involves working 
with business owners to understand and review requirements for new development.
Before moving to the ad tech industry I spent over ten years in the proprietary trading 
industry as a trader and developer.  During this time I gained experience modeling 
financial markets to develop pricing stategies for automated  trading.
